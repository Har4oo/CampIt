# CampIt

Off-work project for summer camp management.

The point of it is to display, edit and store camping data. There are campers, who are part of different teams, take different roles and track data across the whole camp time. Those teams take part in games from which they aquire points. After every game/activity the teams may gain extra points and therefore be listed in a leaderboard.

The goal is to create more interactive environment for the children in order to maintain competitive spirit.

### Extra ideas
- "The Big Game"
CampIt may be included in the game which gives the most points for a team. This game makes the whole camp, all the people from it, to walk/run around the town where the camp is in order to achieve checkpoints which give points. Some sort of free map API could be included to show "checkpoints", "extra side quests" and etc.


### Technology planned
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.5
- PostgreSQL 17
